I have little knowledge about git and git hub
git pull - add file or data in the git hub to display in your working folder
git add . - add one or more working files
git remote add origin - it is origin link to the repository
git init - create a empty repository
git branch - you can see the origin name and also modify the name 
git branch -a - you can visible your branch
git checkout -  use to switch a new branch
